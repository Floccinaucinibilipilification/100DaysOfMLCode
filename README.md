# 100DaysOfMLCode

## Rules and instructions

Check [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cuQMBj1cWPo&t=7s) video on Youtube by Siraj Raval for the #100DaysofMLCode Challenge. 

## Motivation

Machine Learning is the most transformative technology of our time. Whether its helping us discover new drugs for major diseases, fighting fraud, generating music, improving supply chain efficiency, the list of applications are truly endless. In order for us as a community to be able to make valuable contributions to the world, we need to master this technology. This is a call to action, a battle cry, a spark that will light a movement to radically improve the state of humanity. 100 Days of ML Code is a committment to better my understanding of this powerful tool by dedicating at least 1 hour of my time everyday to studying and/or coding machine learning for 100 days. 

## Project Ideas

- My pick is the [CheXpert Competition](https://stanfordmlgroup.github.io/competitions/chexpert/). 

- CheXpert is a large dataset of chest X-rays and competition for automated chest x-ray interpretation, which features uncertainty labels and radiologist-labeled reference standard evaluation sets.

- Chest radiography is the most common imaging examination globally, critical for screening, diagnosis, and management of many life threatening diseases. Automated chest radiograph interpretation at the level of practicing radiologists could provide substantial benefit in many medical settings, from improved workflow prioritization and clinical decision support to large-scale screening and global population health initiatives. 

- A labeled dataset that (1) is large, (2) has strong reference standards, and (3) provides expert human performance metrics for comparison.
