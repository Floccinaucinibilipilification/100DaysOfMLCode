# 100DaysOfMLCode

## Rules and instructions

Check [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cuQMBj1cWPo&t=7s) video on Youtube by Siraj Raval for the #100DaysofMLCode Challenge. 

## Motivation

Machine Learning is the most transformative technology of our time. Whether its helping us discover new drugs for major diseases, fighting fraud, generating music, improving supply chain efficiency, the list of applications are truly endless. In order for us as a community to be able to make valuable contributions to the world, we need to master this technology. This is a call to action, a battle cry, a spark that will light a movement to radically improve the state of humanity. 100 Days of ML Code is a committment to better my understanding of this powerful tool by dedicating at least 1 hour of my time everyday to studying and/or coding machine learning for 100 days. 

## Project Ideas

- My pick is the []() 

- Siraj's pick is [Preventing the Spread of Dengue Fever](https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/44/dengai-predicting-disease-spread/). 
The task is to predict the number of dengue cases each week (in each location) based on environmental variables describing changes
in temperature, precipitation, vegetation, and more. An understanding of the relationship between climate and dengue dynamics can improve research 
initiatives and resource allocation to help fight life-threatening pandemics. You can literally save lives with machine learning.
